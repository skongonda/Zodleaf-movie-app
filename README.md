# Zodleaf-movie-app
Movie info application built with vanilla JavaScript that uses version 3 of the TMDB API

This includes the most popular movies and TV shows with detail pages, a search box for movies and shows with full pagination and a slider for movies that are currently playing in theaters. The slider uses the Swiper library.

## Usage

Just clone or download and then register for a free API key at https://www.themoviedb.org/settings/api

Once you get your key, just add it to the `api.apiKey` value in the global state at the top.

**Note:** If you are using this as a production project, you should not store this in the client. You can create a proxy server and store your key there. I may add that to the repo later on.


Note - This project code is from an online course by "Brad Traversy".
